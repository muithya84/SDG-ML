# SDG-ML
# Disease Outbreak Predictor â€“ SDG 3 Project

# Problem
Diseases like COVID-19 spread rapidly and unpredictably. We aim to predict regional outbreaks based on case and weather data, helping health officials respond faster.

# ML Approach
- Type: Supervised Learning
- Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Features: Previous cases, temperature, humidity
- Target: Outbreak risk (>100 cases)

# Results
- Accuracy > 85% (based on test data)
- Visual, interactive web interface for prediction
- Risk level shown with probability

# Ethical Reflection
- Bias: Predictions depend on historical case reporting
- *Fairness*: Same thresholds for all regions
- *Improvement*: Include demographics or mobility data in future versions

# Tools
Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Streamlit
